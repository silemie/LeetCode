 *
 * Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.
 * 
 * For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some
 * starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections.
 * The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the
 * root.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [1,2,3]
 * 
 * ⁠      1
 * ⁠     / \
 * ⁠    2   3
 * 
 * Output: 6
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
 * 
 * -10
 * / \
 * 9  20
 * /  \
 * 15   7
 * 
 * Output: 42
